Lots of analysis is nuanced, and it's pretty easy to fall into incorrect assumptions and incomplete understanding. That's where this refresher comes in. We'll cover basic definitions through multi-input multi-output linear analysis, and everything in between. These notes are available as a  website, and via  PDF.

We can model each system with equations of motion. These equations describe how each system's state changes! A quick definition for state is described below. We often want to control the state in some way. Think about the populations of predators and prey in an ecosystem, inflation rates in an economy, the orientation of a rocket, the speed of a car, etc.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"note: Definitions\nState â€“ a set of values that completely describe a system!","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Over the years, smart people have developed a field known as controls.

It helps to have a concrete example for a system to control, so let's use one!
