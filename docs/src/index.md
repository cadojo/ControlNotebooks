## About these Notes
Welcome to publicly available notes, with working and run-able examples, which 
provide an overview to control theory. The intended audience are engineering students 
(undergraduate, early graduate) or new professionals who might want a refresher 
for fundamental control theory concepts. 

We'll walk through simple definitions, motivate controls as a topic, 
outline linear systems theory and why it is important, and 
discuss linear and nonlinear controller design and analysis. 
Throughout these notes, one system will be used as an example: a polynomial 
model for a sub-scale radio-controlled aircraft, developed by NASA. 

## Topics to Cover
* __Dynamics:__ definitions, nonlinear dynamics, and linear dynamics
* __Systems Theory:__ linear systems theory, introductory nonlinear systems theory
* __Control:__ control design for linear and nonlinear systems
* __Analysis:__ frequency analysis & other linear analysis techniques, nonlinear analysis

## What's Next?
Move on to Chapter 1 for some motivation behind these notes, and an quick definitions!
