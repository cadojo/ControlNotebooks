# ðŸŽ¢ Control Theory Fundamentals
_Fundamental control theory concepts, and applications with a (rough) approximation of an aircraft model!_

## What's all this?
Welcome to publicly available notes, with working and run-able examples, which 
provide an overview to control theory. The intended audience are engineering students 
(undergraduate, early graduate) or new professionals who might want a refresher 
for fundamental control theory concepts. 

We'll walk through simple definitions, motivate controls as a topic, 
outline linear systems theory and why it is important, and 
discuss linear and nonlinear controller design and analysis. 
Throughout these notes, one system will be used as an example: a polynomial 
model for a model aircraft, developed by NASA. 

## What's Next?
Move on to Chapter 1 for an introduction to the topics we'll discuss throughout these notes!
