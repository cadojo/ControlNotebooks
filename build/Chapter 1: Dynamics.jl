# ## Overview 
# Our end goal as controls engineers is to _affect_ a system in some desired way. 
# To do this, we'll need a mathematical description of our system. This mathematical 
# description is a _model_. There's a famous [quote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong)
# about mathematical models: "all models are wrong, but some are useful". 
#
# This is really important. We are __always__ approximating our system by describing it with a model.
# The question we need to ask is "is our approximate description of our system (our model) good enough?"
